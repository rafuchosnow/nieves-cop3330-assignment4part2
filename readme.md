Welcome to my little to do list app:

- To add an item type a description in the field, 
  select a due date (defaults to current date) and click the
  add item button.
  
- To remove an item select the item you want to remove 
  from the list and click the remove item button.
  
- To clear the list click the clear list button.

- To edit an item select the item you want to edit, type 
  in the new description or change the due date, and 
  add it back to the list.
  
- To mark an item as complete select the item you want to 
  mark as complete and click the mark complete button.
  
- To mark an item as incomplete select the item you want to
  mark as incomplete and click the mark incomplete button.
  
- To sort the list you can click the Sort by button, 
  which allows you to sort by all items, complete items,
  or incomplete items.
  
- To save your list to an external storage select the File... 
  button and click on Save File, then select the path you want 
  to save it to.
  
- To load a list from an external storage select the File...
  button and click on Load File, then select the path you want
  to load it from.

Thanks for the easy points Rey ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
